Platform Purpose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The WaRP7 is the next generation Internet of Things (IoT) and Wearable’s
Reference Platform. WaRP7 is a powerful, low-cost platform designed for
rapid prototyping and reduces time to market. WaRP7 is optimized, comes
is a tiny form factor and yet flexible enough to offer all the
advantages of traditional development tools. It has been architected and
designed from the ground up to address key challenges in the IoT and
wearables markets, such as battery life, connectivity, user experience
and miniaturization. WaRP7 is based on the NXP i.MX 7Solo applications
processor that features an advanced implementation of the ARM®
Cortex®-A7 core, as well as the ARM® Cortex®-M4 core. It comes with
features such as on-board sensors, connectivity including NFC,
Bluetooth®, Bluetooth Smart and Wi-Fi® and on-board external LPDDR3
memory.

Linux Software
--------------

*Note:*

command shown with prefix *$* are to be run on host machine (like ubuntu
etc.)

command shown with prefix *=>* are to be run on uboot prompte

command shown with prefix *~#* are to be run on board after linux up.

[[compilation]]
Compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~

===========================

*Steps:*

\1. Extract the kernel and use the below commands to compile

$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- distclean

$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- warp7_defconfig

$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- zImage

$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- modules

$ make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
imx7d-warp7-mipi-dsi.dtb

\2. Extract and compile imx_usb_loader-master

\3. usb imx_usb, to load uboot first time in the board.

$ cd imx_usb_loader-master

$ make

$ ./imx_usb u-boot.imx

\4. u-boot prompt will come. ( we are using minicom )

\5. Run on uboot

=> ums 0 mmc 0

\6. Now you will able to see emmc of as storage device on your computer.

\7. Use any standard utility to make partition table.

\8. create 3 partitions (10MB(Fat32), 100MB(Fat32) and remaining space
as ext4)

\9. copy zImage to to the 100MB fat32 partition.

10.rename and copy *imx7d-warp7-mipi-dsi.dtb* as *warp7.dtb* to the
100MB fat32 partition.

\11. copy the *rootfs_debian.tar.bz2* to the 3rd ext4 partition.

\12. now install kernel modules to the rootfs as shown below.

$ *sudo make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- modules_install
INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/path_to_your_emmc_ext4_partition_mount*

\13. now unmount the partitions using "**sudo umount /dev/sdX**"
command.

\14. in u-boot prompt, hit **Ctrl+c**, to cancel the mounted mmc.

\15. in u-boot prompt, use *loadx* command to load *uboot* to ram.

after loadx completed , press **ctrl+a**, then s to select xmodem for
uboot transfer.

=> loadx

. save the uboot in emmc.

=> mmc write 0x80800000 2 0x2a6

*<CAUTION>*

\16. now fuse the OTP. This command is one time only, be careful else it
will brick the board .

=> fuse prog 1 3 10002820

\17. set bootcmd environment params as below .

=> *setenv bootcmd 'setenv mmcroot /dev/mmcblk2p3 rootwait rw;setenv
bootargs console=$\{console},$\{baudrate} root=$\{mmcroot};mw 30330218
0;fatload mmc 0:2 0x80800000 zImage;fatload mmc 0:2 0x83000000
warp7.dtb;bootz 0x80800000 - 0x83000000'*

=> *saveenv*

=> *run bootcmd*

Now linux must be up and running.

\18. using NET OVER USB, we build USB ethernet build as **module**.

use below commands on the board to load the modules.

Note: using static IP in your host system. We are using as below in
*/etc/network/interfaces*

*192.168.7.10, *

*255.255.255.0, *

[[testing-audio]]
Testing Audio:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*======================================================*

listen audio from warp7:

place an audio file (ex: input.wav) file in home directory,and run below
command:

*~#* *aplay input.wav *

record audio usingwarp7:

run below command, it will record audio file with 10 secs duration .

*~#* *arecord -d 10 output.wav *

to change volume control of headphone:

below example shows to change volume to 100%

*~# amixer set 'Headphone' 100%*

to change gain control of mic:

below example shows to change gain control to 100%

*~# amixer set 'Mic' 100%*

*Testing Battery Charger:*

*======================================================*

compile & run the "bc3770.c" from the utils folder.

image:media/image93.png[image]

[[testing-sensors]]
Testing Sensors:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*======================================================*

The mpl3115a2 sensor consists of Pressure and Altimeter.

The FXOS8700CQR1 sensor consists of Acclerometer and Magnetometer.

The FXAS21002CQR1 sensor consists of Gyrometer:

run "i2cdetect" command to scan i2c bus for devices.

*UU* shows devices already binded to platform/drivers.

image:media/image94.jpeg[image]

To detect sensor identity status we will check for "**WHOAMI**" register
values:

execute below commands in terminal:

*mpl3115a2:*

*~#* i2cget -y 3 0x60 0x0C

*0xc4*

MPL3115A2 datasheet confirms the "WHOAMI" value.

*FXOS8700CQR1*

**~#**i2cget -y 3 0x1e 0x0D

*0xc7*

FXOS8700CQR1 datasheet confirms the "WHOAMI" value.

*FXAS21002CQR1*

$i2cget -y 3 0x20 0x0C

*0xd7*

FXAS21002CQR1 datasheet confirms the "WHOAMI" value.

image:media/image95.png[image]

With above detection we can confirm the sensor hardware is working.

sample codes "detect_acclerometer.c","detect_gyrometer.c" and
"detect_mpl3115.c" confirm the same.

image:media/image96.png[image]

we developed a simple bare-metal application in Linux to access mpl3115
sensor.

the same can be done for android/yocto platforms .

the code "**mpl3115_temperature.c**" can be compiled and tested to get
temperature values.

you will get result as below (with debug enabled):

image:media/image97.png[image]

(note: the code access */dev/i2c-3* interface, if *MPL3115A2* driver
enabled in kernel, the code will fail due to device blocking by driver)

With testing part over, we can proceed to further development using
kernel supported drivers.

enable the supported drivers in kernel by setting the below values to
"**y**" in *.config* or "**make menuconfig**":

*# CONFIG_SENSORS_FXOS8700 is not set*

*# CONFIG_SENSORS_FXAS2100X is not set*

*# CONFIG_INPUT_MPL3115 is not set*

to

*CONFIG_SENSORS_FXOS8700=y*

*CONFIG_SENSORS_FXAS2100X=y*

*CONFIG_INPUT_MPL3115=y*

applications need to be written from android/debian/yocto interfaces to
access full functionality.

[[testing-wifi]]
Testing Wifi:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*======================================================*

broadcom bcmdhd getting loaded and wireless interface getting up suring
kernel boot.

this comes from enabling "**Broadcom FullMAC wireless cards support** "
